### Hi there, I'm Roger !ðŸ‘‹ 
## âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub profile âœ¨

I'm a technology enthusiast, I'm in the transition of becoming a Dev, I love games and spending time with friends. Much of what I'm learning, I'm seeing through the Alura platform. I still don't have a specific area in mind to pursue, as I said, I'm trying to learn more and I'm interested in everything!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in the public sector where I live
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learn more about this area
